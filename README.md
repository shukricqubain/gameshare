<!-- About the project -->

## ABOUT THE PROJECT

### Description
Gameshare is a social media platform in which users can share their progress in the games they play,
contribute to discussion boards about games, and interact with friends in the platform. User profiles will keep track of each individual game in their collection, their achievement progress in each game (if the game has achievements), their satisfaction of the game, other users they are friends with or interact with, and each board they are subscribed/follow. Each discussion board will center around a singular game (there can be multiple for each game), in which users can discuss lore, fan theories, hard challenges, helpful hints, speedruns, etc. Users can interact with each other via chat messaging directly through their profiles, or posting and replying to one another on a game board.
